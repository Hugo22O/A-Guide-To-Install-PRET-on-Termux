## Installing Termux on your android device

*If you already have termux installed, go ahead and skip this step.*

Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required, we will be using Termux to run PRET. Download & install Termux from the playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux or F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/ After having Termux installed open up the app.
